The latest libc and flex versions are incompatible with the UPMurphi core, which 
unfortunately uses legacy Murphi code. Thus, if you encounter problems

1) check that you have the following versions of byacc, bison and flex installed:
	bison 3.0.4, byacc 1.9, flex 2.5.39 (you can write, e.g., flex -V to read 
	the currently installed version). 
	
	In particular, we are aware of an issue	with flex version >2.5.39 that 
	breaks the building process of the PDDL-to-Murphi compiler (pddl2upm). 
	
	In this case, downgrade to flex 2.5.39.
	To do this, e.g., in Ubuntu 18.04 you have to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
	and ADD the following line at the end of the file to enable the trusty-backports source:
	
	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-backports main restricted universe multiverse
	
	after saving the modified /etc/apt/sources.list, update the apt database with the command
	
	sudo apt update
	
	and finally install the required version of flex from trusty-backports 
	
	sudo apt install -t trusty-backports flex=2.5.39-8~ubuntu14.04.1
	
	
2) check that you have installed libc6-dev-i386, gcc-multilib and g++-multilib
   as described in QUICK_START.txt
	
   If you don't, you may get segmentation faults during the model compilation.
   
   
With these fixes (together with those encoded in the makefiles) we were able 
to compile UPMurphi and successfully run all the examples under Ubuntu 18.04 
with gcc 7.3.0
