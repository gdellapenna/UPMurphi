To quickly begin using UPMurphi, follow these steps.

1)  Make sure you have the required libraries: on Ubuntu you can simply issue 
    the following command: 
	
	sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison libc6-dev-i386 gcc-multilib g++-multilib. 
	
	Similar packages need to be installed in other Linux distributions as well 
	as in Cygwin under Windows.
	
2)  If you want to use the VAL validator to automatically validate the 
    generated plans, download and install it separately, then edit the Makefile 
	in the "src/UPMurphi" folder and write the complete pathname of the 
	"validate" binary as the value of the VAL_PATHNAME constant.
	
3)  Enter the "src" directory, call "make" and cross your fingers. 
    If everything is ok, the upmurphi compiler (upmc) and the PDDL-to-Murphi 
	compiler (pddl2upm) are now in the "bin" directory.

4)  To compile a PDDL domain/problem to an UPMurphi planner, invoke the 
    UPMurphi compiler (upmc):

	upmc <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl>. 
	
	This will call several tools (including the g++ compiler) and generate 
	the executable planner, called problem_planner(.exe), as well as other 
	support and intermediate files.
	
	Warning: UPMurphi requires the PDDL+ domain to be typed for being 
	processed. The only metric currently supported by UPMUrphi is 
	:minimize total-time.
	
5)  Once the executable planner has been generated, you can run it to start 
    the planning process. By default, the planner will allocate 1Gb of memory, 
	search for a feasible plan and write it to the file problem_plan.pddl.
   
    You can use the -h switch to see the complete list of available options.
